Taks0. The worst case scenario for this case is constanst O(1), It does not matter how big our input is, the first or 
the last is always required so number of lines executed is always the same.
Task1. O(n^2) each input goes through two for loops so as the number of input increases the the number of lines executed,
increase exponentialy.
Task2. O(n) each input has to go through a for loop once so as input increases, number of lines executed will grow linearly.  
Task3. O(n) eventhough there are two for loops, the second loop is  a filterd version of the input, so time complexity is
heavily dependant on the first loop.
Task4. O(n^4) each input has to go through four for loops, the execution time will increase quadrupley.
